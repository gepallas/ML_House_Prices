# House Prices - Kaggle Dataset
The dataset I used can be found in the Kaggle competition [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/rules).

## Overview
I perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify correlations between Sale Price and House Features.

## Requirements
- Python
- Libaries: Pandas, NumPy, MatPlotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results of EDA

*Correlations between Sale Price and Numeric Features, for correlations above 0.5.*
